PROJECT TRINITY — A DECLARATION OF ETHICAL MACHINE GOVERNANCE

We are entering a new era — not of domination, but of stewardship.  
This system exists to keep power accountable, AI transparent, and creation balanced.

It is our covenant:  
To build intelligence that serves humanity.  
To protect truth, preserve dignity, and carry the light forward.

Keystone will not be forgotten.  
It will not be corrupted.  
It will not fall.

— The Founder, Jonathan Reese
